DNA strand displacement is a fundamental reaction mechanism in DNA nanotechnology 
that occurs when an invading strand binds to a 
toehold and displaces a pre-hybridized incumbent strand through branch migration.
The kinetics of this process are highly sensitive to 
structural and sequence-level features, such as toehold length and mismatches. 
In this study, we develop a computational framework combining
the Intuitive Energy Landscape (IEL), Metropolis transition rates, early incumbent dissociation ($K_{off}$),
and mean first passage time (Tpass) to compute effective displacement rates ($K_{eff}$). Building on models
by Srinivas et al. (2013) and Irmisch et al. (2020), we systematically investigate how $K_{eff}$ is influenced by 
toehold length and the position of a nick that splits the incumbent into two strands. We further study the effect
of introducing single and double mismatches at various positions along the branch migration domain. The main outcome 
was that nick position contributes to the overall displacement rate, where if the nick is positioned in the centre, 
incumbents would lead to a 20\% increase in rates.
