asses the energy landscape for DNA strand displacement energy =calculates the energy landscape

metropolis calculates the transitions rates by assuming the energy barriers are asymmetric with downhill transitions 
having a constant rate.

kawasaki assumes symmetrical energy barriers between states, both forward and backward rates are similarly affected by
energy difference.

time-mfp calculates the mean first passage time, the avg time it takes for the system to reach the final state
from initial stage.

acceleration: calculates the acceleration by (log10[keff15]/[keff0])
